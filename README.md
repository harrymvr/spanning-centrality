spanning-centrality is a Python module for computing the spanning edge
centrality in a graph. It is built on top of networkx and SciPy and is
distributed under the ISC license.

You can find more about the spanning edge centrality in our paper, 
[Spanning Edge Centrality: Large-scale Computation and Applications](http://cs-people.bu.edu/cmav/downloads/spanning_edge.pdf),
published in WWW 2015.
